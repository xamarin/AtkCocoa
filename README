AtkCocoa

AtkCocoa is a bridge between the Gtk accessibility toolkit: Atk and Cocoa's
NSAccessibility framework. It enables Gtk applications to be accessible on
macOS through technologies like VoiceOver

Building

AtkCocoa is set up as an Xcode project for macOS 10.10+. As such it can be built inside Xcode for development purposes but needs to be installed into
Monodevelop for testing using the provided Makefile

If you are building the AtkCocoa that is inside md-addins/external, then a development version can be installed using

$ make install

Alternatively, AtkCocoa can be developed outside the md-addins tree, if it is placed into the same folder as monodevelop and md-addins. In that case, it can be installed using

$ make install-standalone
